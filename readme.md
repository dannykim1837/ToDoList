## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Task Editing: Implement the ability to edit existing tasks directly within the list, allowing users to modify task details without having to delete and re-add them.
* [ ] Due Dates: Add functionality to set due dates for tasks and display them within the list. This feature will help users keep track of deadlines and prioritize their tasks more effectively.
* [ ] Task Categories: Introduce categories or tags for tasks, enabling users to organize their tasks into different groups (e.g., work, personal, shopping). This will improve task management and make it easier to filter and view specific types of tasks.
